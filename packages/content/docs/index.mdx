## Domain First UI Components

Production-ready React components for **fintech**, **trading**, **banking**, **payments**, and **KYC** applications. Copy, paste, and ship faster.

A comprehensive collection of React components designed for financial applications:

- **Form Input Components** with built-in validation for government documents and financial data
- **Display Components** for presenting financial data with proper formatting
- **Blocks** - pre-built sections for KYC, onboarding, and payment flows
- **Utilities** for handling domain-specific logic and financial transformations

This is **not a traditional component library**. You don't install a package â€“ you copy the source code directly into your project.

## How it works

Domain UI uses a **registry approach** similar to shadcn/ui and depends on the shadcn CLI for component installation:

1. **Browse components** in the registry
2. **Copy the code** into your project using shadcn CLI commands
3. **Customize freely** since you own the source code
4. **No dependencies** to manage or update

## Component Categories

### Form Components

## Installation

Install any component using the registry CLI:

```bash
# Install a component
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add "https://domain-ui.dev/[component-name].json"

# Use in your application
import { ComponentName } from "@/components/domain-ui/[component-path]"
```

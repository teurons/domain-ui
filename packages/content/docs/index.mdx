## What is Domain UI?

Domain UI is a **component registry** that provides specialized React components for building real-world applications. You copy the components into your project and own them completely.

> "Domain-specific components that handle validation, formatting, and compliance out of the box."
A comprehensive collection of React components designed for real-world applications:

- **Form Input Components** with built-in validation and formatting
- **Display Components** for presenting data with proper formatting
- **Blocks** - pre-built sections for common application patterns
- **Utilities** for handling domain-specific logic and transformations

This is **not a traditional component library**. You don't install a package â€“ you copy the source code directly into your project.

## How it works

Domain UI uses a **registry approach** similar to shadcn/ui:

1. **Browse components** in the registry
2. **Copy the code** into your project using CLI commands
3. **Customize freely** since you own the source code
4. **No dependencies** to manage or update

## Component Categories

### Form Components
Input components with built-in validation, formatting, and user guidance for government documents, financial data, and other domain-specific formats.

### Display Components
Components for presenting formatted data with proper styling and accessibility considerations.

### Blocks
Pre-built sections that combine multiple components to solve common application patterns and user flows.

### Utilities
Helper functions and hooks for handling domain-specific logic, transformations, and validation patterns.

## Installation

Install any component using the registry CLI:

```bash
# Install a component
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add "http://localhost:3000/r/[component-name].json"

# Use in your application
import { ComponentName } from "@/components/domain-ui/[component-path]"
```

## Technical Architecture

### Validation Approaches

**Simple Validation**: Basic regex matching with immediate feedback
**Incremental Validation**: NFA-based validation that guides users character-by-character

### Built With

- **Radix UI**: Accessible primitives for complex interactions
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling with design tokens
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety and developer experience

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install a component
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add "http://localhost:3000/r/pan-input.json"

# Use in your app
import { PanInput } from "@/components/domain-ui/india/pan-input"
```

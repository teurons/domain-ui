## Domain First UI Components

Production-ready React components for **fintech**, **trading**, **banking**, **payments**, and **KYC** applications. Copy, paste, and ship faster.

> "Domain-first components that handle validation and formatting out of the box."

A comprehensive collection of React components designed for financial applications:

- **Form Input Components** with built-in validation for government documents and financial data
- **Display Components** for presenting financial data with proper formatting
- **Blocks** - pre-built sections for KYC, onboarding, and payment flows
- **Utilities** for handling domain-specific logic and financial transformations

This is **not a traditional component library**. You don't install a package â€“ you copy the source code directly into your project.

## How it works

Domain UI uses a **registry approach** similar to shadcn/ui and depends on the shadcn CLI for component installation:

1. **Browse components** in the registry
2. **Copy the code** into your project using shadcn CLI commands
3. **Customize freely** since you own the source code
4. **No dependencies** to manage or update

## Component Categories

### Form Components
Input components with built-in validation for KYC documents, financial data, and regulatory requirements.

### Display Components
Components for presenting financial data, trading information, and payment details with proper formatting.

### Blocks
Pre-built sections for KYC onboarding, payment flows, trading interfaces, and banking applications.

### Utilities
Helper functions and hooks for financial calculations, currency formatting, and regulatory validation patterns.

## Installation

Install any component using the registry CLI:

```bash
# Install a component
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add "https://domain-ui.dev/[component-name].json"

# Use in your application
import { ComponentName } from "@/components/domain-ui/[component-path]"
```

## Technical Architecture

### Validation Approaches

**Simple Validation**: Basic regex matching with immediate feedback
**Incremental Validation**: NFA-based validation that guides users character-by-character

### Built With

- **Radix UI**: Accessible primitives for complex interactions
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling with design tokens
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety and developer experience

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install a component
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add "https://domain-ui.dev/pan-input.json"

# Use in your app
import { PanInput } from "@/components/domain-ui/india/pan-input"
```

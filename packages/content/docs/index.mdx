## What is Domain UI?

Domain UI is a component registry for **fintech**, **trading**, **banking**, **payments**, **e-commerce**, and **KYC** applications. It provides components tailored for specific business domains and use cases. Building on shadcn/ui and the React ecosystem, Domain UI offers components designed for domain-specific needs.

## How does it relate to shadcn/ui?

Domain UI extends shadcn/ui with domain-specific components. It uses the same registry approach and CLI tooling as shadcn/ui. Domain UI components follow shadcn's design patterns and use the same Tailwind CSS and accessibility standards, making them compatible with existing shadcn/ui setups.

## Who is Domain UI for?

Domain UI is for developers building business applications that need domain-specific components. When you need components for financial applications, document processing, or compliance workflows, Domain UI provides ready-to-use solutions instead of building these from scratch.

## Code Ownership Model

You copy Domain UI components directly into your project using the shadcn CLI rather than installing packages. This gives you complete ownership of the code to customize as needed.

## Open Source and Community

Domain UI is open source (MIT licensed) and hosted on GitHub. You can inspect, modify, and contribute to the components. Community contributions are welcome for new domains, improvements, and additional use cases.

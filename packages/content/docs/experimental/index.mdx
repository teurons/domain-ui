## What Makes a Feature Experimental?

Features are marked as experimental when they:

- **Have known limitations** or edge cases that aren't fully resolved
- **Use complex implementations** that may need optimization or refactoring  
- **Require more testing** in real-world scenarios
- **May have breaking API changes** in future versions

## Current Experimental Features

The following components are currently experimental:

### Incremental Input Validation

Components with real-time regex validation that prevent invalid input as you type:

- **Regex Input Incremental** - Basic regex input with incremental validation
- **PAN Input Incremental** - Indian PAN card input with real-time validation
- **Passport Input Incremental** - Passport number inputs for various countries

**Known Limitations**: Complex regex patterns with lookaheads may not work correctly for incremental validation.

## Providing Feedback

If you use experimental features, please share your feedback:

- Report bugs or unexpected behavior
- Suggest improvements to the API
- Share your use cases and requirements

Your feedback helps us stabilize these features for general availability.

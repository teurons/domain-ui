# Registry URL Configuration
# The registry is always served by the Next.js app

# Auto-detection (no configuration needed):
# 1. localhost:3000 for local development
# 2. window.location.origin for browser (same domain as the app)
# 3. VERCEL_URL for Vercel deployments
# 4. https://domain-ui.dev as fallback

# Registry paths:
# - /r/{component}.json (free registry)
# - /r-pro/{component}.json (pro registry)

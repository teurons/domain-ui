This tutorial will guide you through the process of embedding X (formerly Twitter) posts in your Fumadocs site. We'll cover installation, component setup, and usage in MDX files.

## Step 1: Install the Required Package

First, you need to install the `react-social-media-embed` package:

```package-install
react-social-media-embed
```

## Step 2: Create the XEmbedClient Component

Create a client component wrapper for the XEmbed component. This needs to be a client component because it interacts with the X embed script.

<include lang="tsx" meta='title="XEmbedClient.tsx"'>
  ../../../components/blog/XEmbedClient.tsx
</include>

The client component wrapper:

- Uses the "use client" directive to ensure it runs on the client side
- Wraps the XEmbed component from react-social-media-embed
- Adds a flex container with center alignment for better display
- Maintains the same API as the original XEmbed component

## Step 3: Add the Component to MDX Components

Update your `mdx-components.tsx` file to include the XEmbedClient component:

```jsx
import defaultMdxComponents from "fumadocs-ui/mdx";
import type { MDXComponents } from "mdx/types";
import { XEmbedClient } from "./components/blog/XEmbedClient";

export function getMDXComponents(components?: MDXComponents): MDXComponents {
  return {
    ...defaultMdxComponents,
    XEmbed: XEmbedClient,
    ...components,
  };
}
```

## Step 4: Use the XEmbed Component in Your MDX Files

Now you can use the XEmbed component in your MDX files:

```jsx
<XEmbed url="https://x.com/rjv_im/status/1912033485285376492" width={325} />
```

## Example

Here's an example of an embedded X post:

<div className="flex justify-center my-6">
  <XEmbed url="https://x.com/rjv_im/status/1912033485285376492" width={325} />
</div>

## Documentation

You can also embed Facebook, LinkedIn etc., too. Refer to [react-social-media-embed](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-social-media-embed) for more details.

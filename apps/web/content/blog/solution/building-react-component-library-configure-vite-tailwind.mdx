In this post, I will walk you through building a React component library using Vite and Tailwind. We will also see how to publish it to npm and use it in a React application. We will integrate auto for versioning and release notes.

## Requirements

- We will create a react component library using Vite and Tailwind
- We will publish the component library to npm
- We will publish documentation to GitHub pages using Docusaurus
- Make all this setup in a monorepo built with Lerna
- Automate Release Versioning & Release Notes using auto

## Setup

### Initialize Codebase

We will use Lerna to set up our codebase and add Docusaurus for documentation.

```bash
npx lerna init --packages="packages/*" --packages="apps/*"
```

### Create Docusaurus App

```bash
npx create-docusaurus@latest apps/docs classic --typescript
```

### Create Vite React App

**Run the following command**

```bash
npm create vite@latest packages/elements -- --template react-ts
```

**Change package name**

Change the name in package.json to `@rcls/elements` (actually to something you like)

### Setup scripts

_Add the following scripts to root package.json_

```js
console.log("1");
console.log("2"); // [!code highlight]
console.log("3");
console.log("4");
```

```json reference title="package.json" customStyling="true"
https://github.com/rjvim/react-component-library-starter/blob/main/package.json#L8-L16
```

<GithubCodeBlock
  url="https://github.com/rjvim/react-component-library-starter/blob/main/package.json#L8-L16"
  extractLines={false}
  highlightLines="{2,8-16}"
/>

<include>../../../lib/source.ts</include>

### Test Setup

- Build docs: `npm run docs:build`
- Build package: `npm run package:build`
- Build everything: `npm run build`

If both of these work, then the setup is complete. If anything seems to fail, you can clean the repo and build again using `npx lerna clean -y && npm install`

### Push to Github

Create a github public repo on Github and push the codebase to it, as in the following steps we would be using github actions.
